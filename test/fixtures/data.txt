Poker Dawgs provides a new level of strategy with wild cards, random score multipliers for each card dealt and a pick your own multiplier bonus round. Poker Dawgs also offers rewards for playing. Each time you play you will accumulate “Dawg Treats” that can be redeemed in the In-App “Pet Store” for more credits. Accumulate enough “Dawg Treats” and you can redeem them for a Gift Card through our web site. For our Top Dawg Players, you can use your video poker skills to win Gift Cards by scoring a million points or more on any game of 1,000 credits or higher. You can play for free by coming back every day to collect your random daily bonus of credits. You can earn more credits by achieving the high score of the day or the month. The higher you score the more credits you will collect from other players. All credits earned in Poker Dawgs can also be used to play our other app called “Dawgs”.\r\nHow the Ladder Scoring System Works:\r\nYour total score will be added up from all 5 hands and submitted once the final hand is complete. If your score qualifies for the leader board, your name and score will be displayed accordingly in the 8 slot 'Ladder' for everyone to see; you will also start accumulating credits while your name remains on the 'Ladder' and other people play. Every time you play, 10% of the credits you used to play will be distributed to each slot on the “Ladder”. For example, if you play the 100 credit game, 10 credits are added to each person currently on the “Ladder”. If you currently occupy 3 slots on the “Ladder” and someone else plays, 10 credits will be added to each of your 3 slots.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ladder' system contains 8 slots and an instant jackpot. Each slot represents a score range, as illustrated below:\r\nSlot 1: 300,000+\r\nSlot 2: 200,000 - 299,999\r\nSlot 3: 150,000 - 199,999\r\nSlot 4: 100,000 - 149,999\r\nSlot 5: 50,000 - 99,999\r\nSlot 6: 25,000 - 49,999\r\nSlot 7: 10,000 - 24,999\r\nSlot 8: 5,000 - 9,999\r\n\r\nIf your total score falls within these ranges your name will occupy the appropriate slot on the “Ladder” which also slides the previous occupant of your slot down 1 slot. For example, if you finish a play with a score of 25,000 and player 'David' was in slot 7 while player 'John' was in slot 8, you will take over slot 7 which pushes 'David' to slot 8 and 'John' is knocked off the “Ladder”. At this point, 'John' collects however many credits he accumulated while on the “Ladder”. Your name will remain in slot 7, collecting credits, until someone else scores 25,000 or more. The obvious goal is to score high enough to get into slot 1. The higher your slot, the longer you will stay on the “Ladder” and the more credits you will collect when you are finally knocked off the “Ladder”.\r\n\r\nThe Jackpot is an instant win of credits or a Gift Card, and you will also take over slot 1! You need to score 1,000,000 or more to win the jackpot for any game.","@appPrice":"0","@appName":"Poker Dawgs","@appIconUrl":"http://flurry.cachefly.net/ad/ad_image/11396_80x80.jpg","@actionUrl":"http://ad.flurry.com/manualGetIPhoneApp.do?v=1&e=smNGyuWFlDP9okUCGcBQrbtHKU19JIjZbVS7gXuaqHb9SMkFnZQ7GUIcJWFxWslAKWFDJRCidAnzWhAEZG58VAiBgta3aOrpxBTsHAgwzZHqHr8hwbw4p0WxHL_AZSJnC4Xm3snrURgTMpY_6wZKgLtrFoyh5EMWVFVq2bOMds-3zgj7pKzti5ZWkVvvhzOJUEjBSf2ZQbPsgDTmMoMgmiLUA60I0t4BTMp3v8aw2sOoNfwGv1F4sw"}]}
